Then came the Titans, all mighty entities, who created the stars, the worlds, the universe,…
From this work, the powerful Titans drew a mighty pride. But also tiredness…
They decided to throw the stars and satellites, used the moons as point marquers et light years as units of measure to know which Titan had won.

This game is called… The Cosmo-Pétonque.

After times, the Titans disappeared, but the game stayed, the most civilized entities kept using this game, solving conflicts and dilemmas by this neutral mean. The universe kept its course, thanks to the power of meteors thrown with precision to the moons cochonnets.

After many cycles, the univers is in danger, it is vast, and all beings aren’t benevolent.

Teksa, the worlds eater, uses the noble arts of Cosmo-Pétonque to play the future of planets. If it loses, it will devour itself, but if it wins, Teksa will consume its planet of choice. And it chose our little blue planet. Its neverending apetite, bringing it closer to us.

We will follow the journey of a chosen one, a being who still hasn’t realised his true potential and  his role in the future of the universe. Watched since young age by the Eyes of Time, he will have to face the mightiest, to hope saving what he holds dearest."
